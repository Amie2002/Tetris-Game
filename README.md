- Provide options for customizing game settings like block speed and scoring.
- Maintain a clean, modular codebase for easier updates and expansions.

## Controls

- Use the ***arrow keys*** to move the blocks left and right
- Use the ***down arrow key*** to move the blocks down faster
- Use the ***up arrow key*** to rotate the blocks
- Press the ***Enter key*** to restart the game after game over
